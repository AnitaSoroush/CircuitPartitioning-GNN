Circuit clustering and circuit partitioning are essential tasks in the Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design flow and are usually solved using algorithmic techniques. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a branch of artificial neural networks, leverage the predictive power of deep learning on graph-structured data. Given the circuitsâ€™ graphical nature, GNNs are increasingly applied to various VLSI design tasks. This research investigates applying GNNs to solve circuit clustering and partitioning. Moreover, a hierarchical framework is suggested, linking the clustering GNN to the partitioning GNN. The proposed method improved the quality of the partitioning solution, in terms of cut size, by, on average, 5.6%.
